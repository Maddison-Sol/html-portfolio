<h1>The Best Movies According to Maddison</h1>
 
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Up</h3>
<p>A cute story of love from young to old. From self growth of becoming bitter to passing that support to younger generation. Russell is like the child Carl could not have. </p>

<h3>Spies in Disguise</h3>
<p>A funny movie about a spy turned pigeon. Learning the lesson that if you fight fire with fire, everyone gets burned. </p>

<h3>Tangled</h3>
<p> Another love story of a girl who finds herself to be the lost princess. My favorite scene is when she finally gets to see the floating lanterns. </p>
