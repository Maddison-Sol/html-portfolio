<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! Welcome to my page! My name is Maddison which you probably already knew. I am 24 years old.</p>

<p>I am just starting my career and trying out new things. I majored in communication & media for my bachelor's degree. I have recently been trying to learn coding.</p>

<p>Some other things about me...I love dogs. I enjoy doing crafts and art projects such as painting, latch hook, making clay charms, and more. I would love to pick up knitting and crocheting. Also, a fun fact about me is that I can juggle.</p>
